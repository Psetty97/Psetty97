# Hi, I'm Prashanth Setty 👋
I'm a Computational Engineer passionate about solving real-world engineering problems using Finite Element Methods (FEM), Multi-Body Dynamics (MBD), and CAD-based product development.

I enjoy bridging the gap between physics-based simulations and practical engineering design — always aiming to improve performance, safety, and efficiency through data-driven analysis.

## 🚀 Technical Competence
- 🏗️ Structural Simulation: FEM-based fatigue analysis, crashworthiness (LS-DYNA), structural-acoustic coupling (Abaqus)
- ⚙️ Multi-Body Dynamics (MBD): Flexible body integration, load path analysis (Simpack, Adams)
- 🎯 CAD & Design: CATIA, Siemens NX, Inventor | Design for manufacturability and assembly (DFMA)
- 📊 Scripting & Automation: Python, MATLAB | Automation of simulation workflows and data processing
- 💻 Solver Logic & Algorithm Development: Numerical methods for PDEs, energy-conserving integrators in FEniCS


## 📌 Master Thesis Project
**Coupled Structural–Acoustic Analysis under Free-Field Conditions**

## 🚀 Top Projects
- 🎯 Coupled Structural–Acoustic Simulation (FEM & BEM)
- 🧠 Constitutive Neural Networks for Hyperelastic Material Modeling (Coming Soon)

## 💡 My Approach
I believe engineering simulations are not just about running software — they are about asking the right questions, understanding the physics, and delivering actionable insights that improve design and safety.

Always learning. Always iterating.
